# Sneakers - Project for the SCA Class
Sneakers is a test project.
This project, codenamed "Sneakers," serves as a testing ground for our scripts.
We leveraged advanced research tools like Gemini Advanced and Abacus.ai alongside Skillable's lab environment.
Our initial attempt to utilize Nishang for vulnerability scanning proved unsuccessful, while PowerView yielded limited results.  
However, Gemini and Abacus provided invaluable real-time feedback on script errors, streamlining the development process and fostering a collaborative learning environment. 
Additionally, we honed our skills in using GitHub for version control and collaboration.
