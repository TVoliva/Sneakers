# Sneakers
Project for the SCA Class
Welcome to the Project!  
Sneakers is a test project.  
To do research and verify the functionality of our scripts we used Gemini Advanced and Abacus.ai along with the laboratory environment provided by Skillable.
We attemtped to download Nishang to download tools for enumeration, scanning and finding vulnerabilities.  We also tried PowerView but we did not have a lot of success.  
Using both Gemini Advanced and Abacus.ai enabled us to test our srcipts and obtain immediate feedback and corrections on where the errors were located.  This enhanced the collaborative learning environment.
We also learned how to use GitHub, to commit changes and how to bring in collaborators on a single project.
